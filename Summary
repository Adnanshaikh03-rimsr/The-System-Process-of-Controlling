# The-System-Process-of-Controlling
This presentation discusses Organisational Control, which is the process of monitoring, measuring, and correcting performance to ensure that an organization meets its goals effectively. It explains the three main types of control: Feed-Forward Control, which anticipates and prevents problems before they occur; Concurrent Control, which makes real-time adjustments to ongoing processes; and Feedback Control, which analyzes past performance to improve future outcomes. The presentation also highlights the importance of benchmarking, where organizations compare their performance with industry leaders, and standards, which set measurable and qualitative criteria for evaluation. It covers business analytics as a tool for data-driven decision-making and emphasizes critical control points, which focus on key areas that require special attention. Additionally, the concept of control as a feedback system is explored, showcasing its role in continuous improvement despite potential challenges like slow implementation. The significance of real-time information and control is also discussed, with examples. Case studies of both successful and unsuccessful organizational control practices are presented, including companies like Amazon, Nestl√©, Southwest Airlines, and GE, as well as examples of organizations that failed due to accounting fraud and weak internal controls. The presentation concludes by stressing the importance of effective control systems in maintaining efficiency, adaptability, and long-term success.
